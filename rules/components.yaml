description: Rules for React and shadcn components
pattern: src/components/**/*.tsx
conventions:
  - Place reusable components in components/common/
  - shadcn components should be in components/ui/
  - Custom components should be in components/[feature]/
  - Use PascalCase for component names
  - Each component should be in its own file
  - Include type definitions using TypeScript interfaces
implementation:
  structure: |
    src/
      components/
        common/          # Shared components
          Button.tsx
          Card.tsx
        ui/             # shadcn components
          button.tsx
          card.tsx
        features/       # Feature-specific components
          auth/
            LoginForm.tsx
          dashboard/
            Overview.tsx

  - Leverage use server and use client directives appropriately
  - Implement proper Suspense boundaries for streaming
  - Support for document hooks in Client Components
  - Utilize React 19's improved error boundary handling
  - Support for automatic batching in Server Components
